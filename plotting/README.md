# Evaluation Code

This directory contains R code to evaluate the results of the experiments.
We use `renv` for dependency management.

## Usage

Open a new R session in this directory.
That should kickstart `renv` and produce a warning about dependencies not having been loaded.
Load them using `renv::restore()`.
